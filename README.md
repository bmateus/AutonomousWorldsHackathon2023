# AutonomousWorldsHackathon2023

A weekend hackathon to hack on @latticexyz Autonomous Worlds' MUD framework. 

see:
- https://v2.mud.dev/
- https://github.com/latticexyz/mud

This caught my attention because it was similar in concept to the diamond standard, and the devs are focused on using it to create on-chain games.
The template I tried uses Phaser3 https://phaser.io/phaser3, which I have also been wanting to try out.
The Entity Component System paradigm that is being used is also very interesting.
